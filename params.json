Either you have to generate them using SSMS or some other tool, or you should write them by hand. For the most part, we have found that writing them by hand works the best for alterations to existing DB objects, such as adding columns or changing constraints or indexes, etc.\r\nThe only time we generate scripts is for new objects, as when we add one or more tables. In that case we usually design them in a diagram, and generate create scripts for them afterward.\r\nEither way, you need to end up with a script.\r\nYou cannot mix DML and DDL in the same batch, so DbScriptomate expects only one of the 2 in a given script file.\r\nYou will copy the content of your scripts into the script files that DbScriptomate generates for you off predefined templates.\r\n\r\nThe templates are written in such a way that each script file is transactional, and has the same semantics whether it is executed manually through SSMS, or automatically by DbScriptomate. Either way, it will rollback if the script file could not be fully applied, and if successful, it will log the fact that the script was applied to the DB so that the same script will not ever be attempted again on the same DB. (That's cool, in case you didn't realise)\r\n\r\nWhy does it exist?\r\n------------------\r\nWe were running in an environment where we make extensive use of SQL Merge Replication. For those who have tried this, you will know that replication puts a number of additional constraints on what you can do to a database.\r\nWe haven't found an existing tool that fit our needs. (I'm not going to recap all the reasons here or tools we investigated)","google":"UA-53680419-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
